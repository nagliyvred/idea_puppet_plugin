idea_puppet_plugin
==================

puppet plugin for IDEA/RubyMine

This plugin is under development and does not support much at this point.
Ready to use binary can be found under dist/ folder.

Current features:
    - basic syntax highlighting (just keywords, no logic yet)
    - comments

Compatibility:
    - should be compatible with all Jetbrains products built on the same platform as IDEA/RubyMine, although I've manged to test it in IntelliJ and RubyMine only


This to do:
    - add smarter parsing and identification of lexical tokens
    - navigation between classes and types
    - error highlighting 
    - usages
    - refactoring support
    - inspections
    - color settings 
    - more?
